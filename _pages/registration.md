Registration and attendance is free of charge, but the venue has a limited capacity of 300, so it is essential that you register if you plan to attend in person. Note that you can also attend virtually and at 'hublets'.

The form below also allows you to submit talk and poster abstracts. **The deadline for talk and poster abstract submission is Friday September 12th!**
