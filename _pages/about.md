What is it like to be a bat? The conclusion in Thomas Nagel’s famous philosophical discourse was that we probably can never know. However, as animal behaviourists, it is imperative that we both understand the sensory world of other species and incorporate that knowledge in our studies of behaviour. Behaviour is how animals interact with their environment and the senses provide the information necessary for decision-making. Furthermore, in a rapidly changing world, human sounds, light, smells and magnetic fields swamp sensory systems and decision-making processes that evolved under different conditions, leading to maladaptive behaviour. 

This year’s ASAB Winter meeting explores how sensory information shapes animal behaviour across species and environments. We invite submissions on any topic within this general theme, pure or applied, and including technological solutions to the challenges of understanding non-human sensory experience. The meeting is free, but the venue’s capacity is limited and so **registration is essential**. 

For those presenting posters, we suggest a size of A0 (841x1189mm) in portrait orientation.
