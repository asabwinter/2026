## Outreach Lecture 2025

**Innes Cuthill** has been Professor of Behavioural Ecology at the University of Bristol since 1998. Before moving to Bristol in 1989, he did a DPhil and then held research fellowships at the University of Oxford. Although he has dabbled in various areas of behavioural ecology, for the last 25 years  he has been collaborating closely with physiologists, perceptual psychologists and computational neuroscientists to understand how animal coloration (notably camouflage) evolves in response to animal colour vision. Awards include the Scientific Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the first Nature/NESTA mentorship award and the 2018 ASAB medal, having also served as President of ASAB from 2007–10.
